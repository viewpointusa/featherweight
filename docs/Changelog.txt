Version x
-changed conversion of flattened string data in xnode so that it handles variants on the input, may require a resave of old VIs

-added other waveform data types to conversion

Version 1.9.1
-fixed corner case of JSON deserialize not properly formatting an empty array of clusters

Version 1.9.0
-added a reply send worker to TCP so that actors don't wait for reply messages to send before moving on

Version 1.8.0
-exposed the connection timeout parameter for FTW-Subscriber-Subscribe.vi
-made the timeout input optional for FTW-Subscriber-AddAddresses.vi
-fixed issue with FTW-Actor-Destroy.vi that failed to close local messengers with an incoming error

-fixed issue with removing the wrong child connection from actor extended

Version 1.7.3
-fixed issue with extended actor fetching the wrong child

Version 1.7.2
-inverted timeout and error case in endpoint receive worker to fix CPU railing when publisher is killed before subscriber

Version 1.7.1
-fixed issue with not escaping pre-populated connections in FTW-Ether-Configuration-Populate.vi

Version 1.7.0
-added dummy launcher template
-added FTW-JSON-Lint.vi to check a JSON string for validity as well as the best way of formatting a JSON string with indents (pretty print)
-added RT LED actor template
-fixed a bug in FTW-JSON-SerializeElement.vi because of missing encoding flags
-added extended actor class that automatically registers subscribers and connections
-added app launcher template

-added connection dictionary to Ether for actors launched from Ether launch VIs
-added tool to view actors in memory and open their FPs or BDs
-changed the event logger to publish a JSON flattened event message instead of the fully flattened event text
-added SQLite transaction wrappers

Version 1.6.1
-fixed bug in TCP request worker that would rail CPU if named connection is not found

Version 1.6.0
-added an optional event publisher to the event logger
-log file name now includes time
-new log files can be created on a periodic basis using the LV time conversion code for the period desired (i.e. "FilePeriod": "m" will create a new log file each month)
-added some boilerplate code to the actor template (class)
-wired out roundtrip time on SendPoisonPill

Version 1.5.1
-fixed: in some cases a JSON string was escaped twice leading to the actor file path not being correct

Version 1.5.0
-made message payload a strict type to avoid excessive JSON merging, which would cause cRIO to crash with large JSON strings
-upgraded JSON methods to a newer version of FTW DLL
-added remove addresses method to subscriber

Version 1.4.0
-added VI to launch actors using VI reference
-made JSON Deserialize XNode work in cRIO and with no DLL (opt out)!
-changed actor template connector to a bag of templates instead of a class, this should help with coupling of actors
-using a "#" at the beggining of a FTW job line will comment that job out, also can be used for inline comments
-improvements to native JSON handling
-added JSON get element and JSON keys methods
-actors can now be launched with minimal JSON configuration elements (i.e. only Identity and InboxAddress are required)
-FTW-Ether-NewLoggerConnection.vi now throws a warning if using the default logger
-reply will now automatically include incoming error and pass to requester
-added method to begin shutdown sequence on an incoming error
-added method to throw error conditionally
-other minor BD cleanups
-changed message to be a package for a payload cluster instead of a string array
-modified request receive to have the same behavior for both TCP and inproc
-gave sockets unique wires
-added Color VIs
-improvements to tests
-added FTW-Time-Now.vi
-changed warnings to use LV error dialog compatible source

Version 1.3.4
-fixed issue with local message workers not having unique lossy queues, this would cause multiple lossy local message workers to stomp each other's messages

Version 1.3.3
-fixed bug in FTW-Endpoint-Receive-Worker.vi where connection would not be closed if subscriber killed receive pipe, this would cause publisher to continue to fill queue when subscriber stopped receiving

Version 1.3.2
-fixed bug found by Lew in FTW-Actor-LocalMessage-Worker.vi where the wrong wire was used for timing the loop

Version 1.3.1
-fixed bug found by Lew where Subscriber would run full throttle when no publisher is broadcasting

Version 1.3
-added missing VC++ dependency installer
-removed baked in actor publisher, publishers should be added as needed to any actors that publish
-added FTW-JSON-Object-Update.vi for merging JSON strings and updated Actor Template_Launch.vi to utilize it

Version 1.2.1
-JSON integer add pair was not working correctly, changed data type to I64 to fix

-reorganized for a cleaner structure, source can now be used as an external and all dependent code is included
-added examples
-added body output on request interpret
-some other bug fixes and BD cleanups
