# January 2019 (v2.0.0) (unreleased)

## Breaking changes
* The *Initialized Response* input to `FTW-Actor-Initialized.vi` must be a valid JSON object (i.e. `{"a":"b"}`)
* Actors defined in an app launcher implementation using the `ActorVIFilepath` config element and only specifying a file name must now use the `ActorVIName` element (current custom copies of the app launcher are immune to this change)
* Any VI that formats JSON now defaults to NOT pretty print
* Added option for real number formatting in JSON serialize, default to 6 digits of precision hiding zeros
* `HandshakeTimeout` config element has been replaced by `InitTimeout` and `ConstructTimeout`
    * `InitTimeout` is the more direct replacement for `HandshakeTimeout` and is the time from actor construct to initialization complete
    * `ConstructTimeout` is the time for the VI to start executing and respond to the launcher and is not needed in most cases (hence leaving it off the connector pane)
* The merge of `FTW-ActorExtended` functionality into `FTW-ActorInstance` will cause actors of any type to be broken. See the instructions below for resolutions.

### When upgrading actors that inherit from **`FTW-ActorInstance.lvclass`**:
* Your initialize VI will need to change its output to from the two individual event registration refnums to the cluster of 3
* Do one of two things to resolve the broken event registration refnum wires
    * Unbundle the 3 event registration refnums and rebundle with your (now 4th) refnum
    * OR remove your custom code for pub/sub and use the built in functionality of the base actor class

### When upgrading actors that inherit from **`FTW-ActorExtended.lvclass`**:
1. When opening your project browse to fix all missing extended actor functions with the equivalent name that starts with `FTW-Actor-`
1. Change inheritance to `FTW-ActorInstance.lvclass` (DO THIS BEFORE PROCEEDING)
1. Replace instances of `FTW-ActorExtended-Initialize.vi` with `FTW-Actor-Initialize.vi`

## Dynamic dispatch actors
* Actors can now inherit from `FTW-ActorInstance.lvclass` and override `FTW-Actor.vi` to launch actors as a dynamic dispatch VI (see examples)
* Actors can be created by using the default logic of the base `FTW-Actor.vi` and overriding methods as needed
    * `FTW-Actor-HandleEvents.vi`
    * `FTW-Actor-HandleLocalMessages.vi`
    * //TODO: add others

## JSON updates
* JSON parsing uses a lexical parser written in LV, Jansson is gone
* Native LV parser is portable to any NI platform (OS)
* Lexical parser is orders of magnitude faster than regex and is close in speed to Jansson
* Parser will report errors with location of parser fail similar to Jansson

## Test executive
* A test executive (TE) has been added for simple sequencing of steps written as ephemeral actors
    * Sequences actors based on a JSON script
    * Basic start/stop/pause/step functionality
    * Publishes status
* A GUI template is provided

## Negative actor initialization
* Actors can now "fail" to initialize by passing a Boolean false string to the `FTW: Initialize` job (ex. `"FTW: Initialize = F"`). This will reply to the launcher that the actor init has failed, so that it is not waiting to timeout. It is up to the actor to continue shutting itself down.
* Existing behavior is preserved by defaulting to true if a value is not passed in
* Actors should immediately shut down if sending back a negative initialization

## New templates
* Dynamic dispatch actor and launch templates
* Test exec
    * Custom test executive override
    * Wait step type
    * Step template
    * Basic GUI

## Container data type
* This is a new concept used by the JSON library to manipulate data instead of strings
* Container class is a generic data type that will convert most data types in LV to one of the primitive types (Bool, int, real, string, cluster, array)
    * Used to convert to/from JSON, but can be used as a generic container for manipulating data in ways that LV does not allow natively (i.e. combining clusters)
    * Can be searched/added/removed much like a JSON or XML object
* The purpose of this was mainly for JSON, but it could be used for other serialized data formats, like XML

## Improvements to actor configuration
* VIs were added to [/actor/Config](../../source/actor/Config) to properly format config elements
* Actors can define their own `ExpectedInitTime` element prior to `FTW-Actor-Initialize.vi` to let the launcher know how long to wait. The default value for *Init Timeout* on launch is now `-2`, which corresponds to "use the value specified by the actor" (10 sec default). Any value `>=-1` will use the input value instead of the actor specified value.
* The following ways to define an actor location are now supported: 
    * `ActorVIFilepath`
    * `ActorVIName`
    * `ActorClassFilepath`
    * `ActorClassName`
* The VI/Actor must be in memory for `ActorVIName` and `ActorClassName` to work
* Namespaces must be used if the VI is in a class and using `ActorVIName`

## Ether
* Ether construct will not run again if ether destroy was not called to destroy the current instance

### Extended actors
* Can now add publishers dynamically with `FTW-ActorExtended-Publisher-Add.vi`
* Added VIs to declare connections/subscriptions/publishers from within actor
* Connection/subscription addresses are now looked up at the time of connect/sub instead of prior to the actor launch
* Inbox/publisher addresses are registered with the Ether at the time of construction instead of after actor launch

## Notable fixes
* Restored `FTW-JSON-Object-Keys.vi`
